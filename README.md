I was never good at descriptions. So here are some quotes that resonate with me:  

"She was lost in her longing to understand." 
  - Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Love in the Time of Cholera 

"We cross our bridges as we come to them and burn them behind us, with nothing to show for our progress except a memory of the smell of smoke, and the presumption that once our eyes watered."
  - Tom Stoppard, Rosencratz and the Guildenstern Are Dead
